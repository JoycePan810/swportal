About the Seminar
----------------------

sciwork seminar is a one-day event to include technical talks, tutorials, and coding activities. 
The event is designed to include all angles for those who are interested in developing robust software 
for solving real-world problems regardless of the popularity of the applications. Because it is all-angle, 
the seminar aims at connecting highly motivated developers to junior practitioners, as well as prospective 
employers who have problems to be solved.
