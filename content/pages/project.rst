modmesh seamlessly mixes C++ and Python through pybind11, allowing you to leverage the strengths of 
both programming languages for efficient PDE solving. We use Qt to visualize the computation results 
to make you understand your PDE solution. We recently tried to add Gmsh to load the custom mesh to solve 
the PDE problem. 

Modmesh is designed to run on Windows, Linux, and macOS. Everyone can use or contribute to modmesh.

Python has become a programming language that everyone knows. There are many learning communities. Our 
mission is to make Python's knowledge accessible to the Traditional Chinese community. We're proud to 
announce that we've already translated 31.01% of Python 3.12 official documentation.

Our team regularly organizes translation meetups to maintain a steady progress of translation. In our 
recent meetup, we completed the translation of the string module page. There are many documents being 
translated at the same time. Wellcome to join us.

sciwork portal
----------------

- **Project Link:** `Github <https://github.com/sciwork/swportal>`__
- **Project Contact:** Aya yu (discord: @tN#6722), Chester (discord: @chester)

Sciwork Portal is a project for maintaining our official website - Sciwork.dev, which was built by Pelican 
with tailwindCSS, and deployed by Netfliy. We create the promotional pages for meetup and sprint events. Our 
team also maintains the sciwork conference page - conf.sciwork.dev.

We have always been actively trying to provide users a better web browsing experience, including information 
presentation and visual experience. Welcome to join us if you are interested in website maintence.

pyLiteracy

- **Project Contact:** Jonathan Chen (discord: @陳畯田), PeterWolf (discord: @PeterWolf#1422)

pyLiteracy is originally used to check whether Mandarin LocativePeriodic-zai [在] and Repetitive-zai 
[再] are used correctly or not. We use the Loki model to parse the structure of the sentence,and then 
check whether the word is used correctly or not.

It is now possible to check many different grammars. In order to check more grammar, we still have a 
lot of materials to prepare and features to develop. Welcome to join us.

uTensor
--------

- **Project Link:** `Github <https://github.com/uTensor/uTensor>`__
- **Project Contact:** Dboy(discord: @dboyliao#1295)

uTensor is an extremely lightweight machine learning inference framework built on TensorFlow and optimized 
for Arm targets. It simplifies model deployment by seamlessly converting TensorFlow-trained models into efficient 
C++ files that can be used to infer on the embedding device.The core engine minimizes the usage of RAM ensuring 
optimal system performance.

We provide the defaults for tensors, operators, and memory allocation. Just like the booming development of 
machine learning, we are also actively developing the above functions. Welcome to join us.

Cytnx
------

- **Project Link:** `Github <https://github.com/Cytnx-dev/Cytnx>`__
- **Project Contact:** Lin Chang Teng (discord: @jeffry1829#0568), Ke Hsu (discord: @kjjjjjjjjj1104#5128)

Cytnx provides a similar experience as using numpy/scipy/pytorch. The library is built with C++ and Python 
in mind right at the beginning of development. Nearly 95% of the APIs are exactly the same. It also supports 
multi-devices(CPUs/GPUs) directly on the base container level. This provides an easy-to-use interface for users 
to accelerate their code.

Cytnx was originally designed to handle physics algorithms. We provide powerful tools  such as UniTensor, 
Network, Bond, Symmetry etc. There are some physics algorithms that have been implemented using the Cytnx library.

There are still many scientific libraries and physics applications being developed. Welcome to join us to contribute 
to Cytnx.
